### Competition

Overview: Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: Your goal is to predict rainfall for each day of the year.

Evaluation: Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
